# Messaging service
 Essentially I see online people with no knowledge just starting coding projects and learning as they go from these projects My goal here is to make a messaging website. I think it's a good idea because it would require knowledge in HTML, CSS, Javascript, as well as a server side-language (python, nodeJS, ruby, java, etc.) I think the HTML and CSS can easily be split by page,  meaning you do one page i do another. For the javascript I can let yo play with that because I know it is what you are learning, if not we do page for page as well, which is also fine. For the server-side work (where the messages are stored and retrieved and sent) I would work on this, because I always liked it, but I can give tasks for you and for me as well if your interested.
